**About:** Hello!  I'm a Ph.D. Student at Washington University ([WashU](https://washu.edu/)) working under the supervision of Prof. [Yevgeniy Vorobeychik](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ptI-HHkAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant (RA) at Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad ([IIT-H](https://www.iith.ac.in/))  under the guidance of Prof. [Vineeth N Balasubramanian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7soDcboAAAAJ&hl=en). During my  RA-ship, I worked on Adversarial Machine Learning. Before that, I worked at [Quest Global](https://www.quest-global.com/), India as a Deep Learning R&D Engineer. I also graduated from Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad with an M.Tech degree. 

**Research:** My goal is to build powerful AI models capable of understanding, generating, and reasoning with high-dimensional data across diverse modalities. My primary research interest lies in developing methods to solve real-world problems of broad societal relevance involving Sequential Decision-making under Uncertainty. Currently, my focus is on leveraging Generative Modeling techniques to enhance decision-making under partial observability, while also investigating their potential to drive scientific discovery.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
