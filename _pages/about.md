**About:** Hello!  I'm a Ph.D. Student at Washington University ([WashU](https://washu.edu/)) working under the supervision of Prof. [Yevgeniy Vorobeychik](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ptI-HHkAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant (RA) at Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad ([IIT-H](https://www.iith.ac.in/))  under the guidance of Prof. [Vineeth N Balasubramanian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7soDcboAAAAJ&hl=en). During my  RA-ship, I worked on Adversarial Machine Learning. Before that, I worked at [Quest Global](https://www.quest-global.com/), India as a Deep Learning R&D Engineer. I also graduated from Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad with an M.Tech degree. 

**Research:** My goal is to build powerful AI models capable of understanding, generating, and reasoning with high-dimensional data across diverse modalities. I am interested in developing methods to solve real-world problems of broad societal relevance involving Sequential Decision-making under Uncertainty. Currently, my focus is on leveraging Generative Modeling techniques to enhance decision-making under partial observability, while also investigating their potential to drive scientific discovery.

**Note:** Feel free to contact me via Gmail if you're interested in discussing my ongoing work or exploring collaboration opportunities in generative modeling for scientific discovery-related challenges. I'd be excited to connect!
